#put the following in config/environments/production.rb

# In order for serve the compiled assest correctly
  # you need to precompile the asset in production, the complied content will be located under public folder
  # RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
  # then turn the config.serve_static_asset = true, serving the compiled assets under public folder
  # Although config.assets.compile = true can also work, but this will be very slow since it dynamically compile the assets if it is missing
  config.serve_static_asset = true
